### Hi there 👋

I am Sanket. Thanks for dropping by! I'm a product builder at heart who loves to create tools that empower developers and designers. I co-founded [GeekyAnts](https://geekyants.com) and served as CEO for over a decade, helping scale it into a global design and development powerhouse. Today, my co-founder Pratik leads as CEO while I continue to support the team as a board member and evangelist.

Currently, I'm building [RapidNative](https://rapidnative.com) at my new company Shaper Studio Inc — a prototyping tool for mobile apps, designed for builders, founders, product managers, and UX designers. I've created several developer tools including [gluestack](https://gluestack.io) (formerly known as [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io)) and [BuilderX](https://v1.builderx.io). I also maintain open source projects like [React Pluggable](https://react-pluggable.github.io) and [SyncState](https://syncstate.github.io).

Whether it's building companies, speaking at events, or designing systems, I love solving high-leverage problems that make teams faster and products better.
