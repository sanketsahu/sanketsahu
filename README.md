### Hi there 👋


I am Sanket. Thanks for dropping by! I like to Code and build Products for Designers & Developers. I co-founded [GeekyAnts](https://geekyants.com) and currently leading it along with other [great leaders](https://geekyants.com/team). I'm in love with React Native and Flutter. Addicted to ~~wanderlust~~ working from home, wannabe backpacker (2020 😏) and love to strum the guitar to Prateek Kuhad tunes. You can find me at ~~events like Chain React and React Native Europe~~ online meetups and conferences like React Europe, AwesomeConf, React Native Remote and my personal coding streams.
