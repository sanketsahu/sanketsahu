### Hi there 👋


Built a QBasic imitation of MS-DOS to trick people with C:/> prompts at the age of 8, I have come a long way since and identify myself as an Open Source guy who loves to experiment with new tech. I live to break it, hack it, and build it. Currently in love with React Native and Flutter. Addicted to wanderlust, wannabe backpacker and love to strum the guitar to Prateek Kuhad tunes. You can find me at events like Chain React and React Native Europe.
